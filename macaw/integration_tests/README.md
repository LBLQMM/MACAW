# Tests

We have created unit and integration tests for **MACAW**. Unit tests test the working of each function, whereas integration tests test how these functions work together. You can find unit tests for each main file in a file with '_tests' appended to it (e.g. 'macaw_tests.py for macaw.py'). You can find all integration tests in this directory. 

If you want to run the tests, just type 'pytest' at the root directory ('/MACAW').
